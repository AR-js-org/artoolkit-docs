osgART version 1.0
------------------

OSG version 1.1 or later is required, with OSG version 1.2 recommended.

Using a binary installation of OSG is recommended. Binary installers for
Windows (32 bit), Mac OS X, and Fedora Core 4 Linux are available
directly from the OSG web site. [OSG 1.2 download
page](http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads/PreviousReleases).
For other platforms, you should download and build OSG from source,
following instructions on the OSG website.

### Windows

A binary installer for OSG 1.2, with binaries built against MS Visual
Studio .NET 2003 is distributed from the OSG website, and can be
downloaded at
[1](http://www.openscenegraph.ORG/downloads/binaries/old/osg1.2_setup_2006-09-13.exe).

For users who wish to link applications built with MS Visual Studio 2005
with OSG, we have built a binary installer for OSG which links
correctly. This can be downloaded at
[2](http://www.artoolworks.com/dist/osgart/release/1.1/osg1.2_setup_2007-03-30_vs80.exe).

By default, the installer places the root of the OSG install in the
directory C:\\Program Files\\OpenSceneGraph. This value is then added to
an environment variable \$(OSG_ROOT), and this variable can be used in
Visual Studio project files.

It is highly recommended that you add the actual OSG header and libary
directories to the Visual Studio default search paths for all projects.
This proceeds thus:

1.  From the "Tools" menu, choose "Options".
2.  The options window: In the left-hand pane, click on "Projects".
3.  Two groups are revealed: Click on the "VC++ Directories" group.The
    right-hand pane shows directories.
4.  Under the menu item "Show directories for:" choose "Include files".\
5.  The box shows currently configured global include paths. Five
    buttons are shown above it. Click on the button marked with a shiny
    folder ("new"). Space to add a new path is added.
6.  In the box, type C:\\Program Files\\OpenSceneGraph\\include
7.  Under the menu item "Show directories for:" choose "Library files".\
8.  The box shows currently configured global include paths. Five
    buttons are shown above it. Click on the button marked with a shiny
    folder ("new"). Space to add a new path is added.
9.  In the box, type C:\\Program Files\\OpenSceneGraph\\lib

Additionally, you should add the OSG binaries directory to the system
path if you want it to automatically find the OSG plugins and DLLs.

### Mac OS X

The OSG 1.2 Disk image is at
[3](http://www.openscenegraph.org/downloads/binaries/old/OpenSceneGraph-1.2-2.dmg).

The Disk image doesn't actually install the OSG files to any particular
location, but it is recommended that you place the OSG Frameworks and
Plugins onto a default system path. These are /Library/Frameworks and
/Library/Plug-ins (for all users) or \~/Library/Frameworks and
\~/Library/Plug-ins for only the current user.

### Linux

The Fedora Core 4 binary packages are at
[hhttp://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads/FedoraCore4].
