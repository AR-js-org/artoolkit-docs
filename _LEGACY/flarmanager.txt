FLARManager Online Resources
----------------------------

FLARManager is a lightweight framework developed by Eric Socolofsky that
makes it easier to build augmented reality applications for Flash. It is
compatible with a variety of tracking libraries and 3D frameworks, such
as FLARToolKit, and provides a more robust event-based system for
managing marker addition, update, and removal. It supports detection and
management of multiple patterns, and multiple markers of a given
pattern.

FLARManager is provided under a dual license model (GPL and commercial)
and so there is a large community of developers. Many of these
developers have produced online resources to help teach people how to
use FLARManager, or examples showing different programming tricks. In
this section we provide links to some of the best online resources.

The main FLARManager download site is
