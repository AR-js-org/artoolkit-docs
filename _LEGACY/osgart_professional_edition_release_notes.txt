    About this archive.
    -------------------
    This archive contains the osgART Standard Edition SDK and examples, version
    1.1.3.

    This archive was assembled by:

    About osgART.
    -------------
    osgART is a library that simplifies the development of Augmented Reality or
    Mixed Reality applications by combining the well-known ARToolKit tracking
    library with OpenSceneGraph. But rather than acting just as a simple nodekit,
    the library offers 3 main functionalities: high level integration of video input
    (video object, shaders), spatial registration (marker-based, multiple trackers),
    and photometric registration (occlusion, shadow).

    With osgART, users gain the benefit of all the features of OpenSceneGraph (high
    quality renderer, multiple file type loaders, community nodekits like osgAL,
    etc.) directly in their augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) or mediated
    reality applications. As with the standard ARToolKit, the user can thus develop
    and prototype interactive applications that can use tangible interaction (in
    C++, Python, Lua, Ruby etc.).

    The latest version of osgART is always available from ARToolworks at
    http://www.artoolworks.com/products/osgart/.

    osgART is supported on the Linux, Windows, and Macintosh OS X platforms. As
    OpenSceneGraph's API changes frequently, each version of osgART will now support
    a single version of OSG. Additionally, on Windows, a binary release is provided
    for only a single version of the compiler tools (although binaries can be built
    with the other supported compiler versions from source). Please refer to the
    ChangeLog for the applicable version numbers for this release.


    The osgART license model.
    ----------------------------

    IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR RIGHT TO USE OSGART:

    osgART is published in two editions; Standard and Professional.

    Like ARToolKit, osgART is freely available for non-commercial use under the
    terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. These editions allow
    users of the tool kits with limited feature or support needs, and developers of
    GPLv2-licensed software, to become familiar with AR software development.
    osgART Professional Edition is the right products for users demanding the latest
    features, priority professional support options, and access to advanced and
    experimental AR software techniques, and those for whom development under the
    GPL is not practical.

    We believe this model offers the best of both worlds. Persons developing their
    software under an open source model are freely availed of the standard editions
    source code, and the open source project benefits in return from enhancements,
    bug reports, and external development ideas. Those persons developing under a
    proprietary source model, from who the code base does not benefit through
    reciprocal openness, contribute financially instead. License fees fund research
    and development of today and tomorrow's versions of the products through
    research activities at partner institutions.


    The GPL-licensed osgART Standard Edition.:

    osgART Standard Edition is a basic version of osgART and is freely licensed
    under the terms of the GNU GPL license. It includes an ARToolKit plugin and
    numerous examples which will guide you through from a simple video viewer to a
    animated, interactive AR application.

    osgART Standard Edition comes without support, but an active community of osgART
    users has already developed and joining this community is recommended for all
    osgART users. The osgART community website:
    http://www.artoolworks.com/community/osgart/

    osgART Standard Edition versions 1.0 - 1.1 are GPL-licensed. Please read the
    full text of the GPL prior to downloading and/or using the osgART Standard
    Edition source code. Your downloading and/or use of the code signifies
    acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license. If you are unable to
    comply with the license terms, please immediately destroy all copies of the code
    in your possession.

    Please be aware that while the GPL allows you to freely use the source code, it
    also imposes certain restrictions on the ways in which you can use the code.
    Your attention is drawn particularly to section 2b of the GPL: "You must cause
    any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
    derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.", i.e. your
    software incorporating or linking to osgART Standard Edition must also be
    open-source software, licensed under the GPL. Use of the osgART Standard Edition
    in breach of the terms of the GPL will be subject to legal action by the
    copyright holders.

    The commercially-licensed osgART Professional Edition:

    osgART Professional Edition is an advanced version of osgART with plugins for a
    variety of different tracking architectures including ARToolKit Professional and
    ARToolKit NFT, advanced video input plugins and support for a wide variety of
    high-end video sources, extended examples including advanced rendering
    techniques, and much more.
    Licenses for osgART Professional Edition are fee-bearing, but allow access to
    the advanced features and inclusion of osgART in propriety products.

    Priority technical support, access to the osgART developers, and hot code fixes
    are available from ARToolworks, Inc.
    osgART Professional Edition is the right product for professional and commercial
    use by persons for whom the GPL license terms are not ideal. License
    arrangements are managed by ARToolworks, Inc. A variety of license types are
    available at reasonable cost.

    http://www.artoolworks.com/support/library/Installing_and_building_osgART.
    (Registration required to view).


    Changes in version 1.1.3 (this release) (2010-08-24).
    -----------------------------------------------------
    - A new tracker plugin for ARToolKit NFT2 has been included. The tools for
    building NFT2 marker sets are available to licensees of ARToolKit NFT2.
    - The supported version of OpenSceneGraph is 2.8.2.
    - On Windows, binaries are provided for Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (VS90sp1). Visual
    Studio 2005 SP1 is also supported. Support for the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    2003 (Visual C v7.1) has been dropped.
    - Fixes to enable correct operation of ID-based markers in the ARToolKit4 and
    ARToolKit4NFT trackers. These can now be specifed by using the a hash symbol
    ("#") followed by the ID-number in place of the pattern file name. Requires
    ARToolKit Professional v4.4.2 or later.


    Changes in version 1.1.2 (2009-09-15).
    --------------------------------------
    - Updated for compatibility with ARToolKit v4.4.0.
    - Added project files for Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (vs90), in addition
    to Visual Studio .NET 2003 (vs71) and Visual Studio 2005 SP1 (vs80).


    Changes in version 1.1.1 (2009-03-06).
    --------------------------------------
    - Updated video plugins for compatibility with OSG versions > 2.5.
    - Now explicity links against OpenThreads on Win32 platforms, to be compatible
    with OSG versions > 2.5.
    - Updates to ARToolKit4 tracker plugin: requires ARToolKit v4.3.3 or later.
    - Major update to the ARToolKit4NFT tracker plugin: requires ARToolKit NFT
    v3.24.3 or later.
    - Add field "labelingMode" to ARToolKit4/4NFT trackers to allow toggling of
    black vs. white markers.
    - ARToolKit4NFT tracker: fix pagemode bugs which caused unreliable switching
    between pages. Now provides field (1-based integer index) to allow reading of
    "current page" value.
    - ARToolKit4NFT tracker: fix matching threshold, and add field to allow
    adjustment of matching threshold (range [0,1]).
    - ARToolKit4/4NFT trackers: add support for display of debug display of matched
    fiducial markers.


    Changes in version 1.1 (2008-02-20).
    ------------------------------------
    Although osgART functionality remains similar, version 1.1 includes major
    architectural changes over version 1.0.
    - The ARToolKit tracker is now self-contained in a plugin, allowing different
    versions of ARToolKit (open source v2.x vs. Professional v4.x, NFT) to be used,
    as well as other tracker libraries.
    - Video plugins now return frames in the standard osg::Image type, allowing
    video to be more easily utilised elsewhere in the scene graph.
    - Tracker plugins now accept the standard osg::Image type.
    - Connection of the video and the tracker is achieved using a new OSG node type,
    ARSceneNode, which is subclassed from osg::Group, eliminating the need for a
    separate run loop inside osgART.
    - The video background functionality has been restructured, eliminating some
    small utility classes in favour of achieving the same effect with standard OSG
    calls.
    - Passing of data to and from the video and tracker plugins is now managed
    through fields, dynamically typed accessors which allow for plugins to accept
    and supply a variety of different data types.



    Known issues in this release.
    -----------------------------
    - This release will break previously working code targeted at osgART-1.0. Please
    use the osgARTTest.cpp sample to update your usage.
    - Due to an issue in OpenSceneGraph, YCbCr-format video streams are not yet
    supported. On Mac OS X, make sure that ARToolKit's default video format is ARGB.
    - The Mac osgARTTest opens in multiple windows on a multi-display system.


    Changes in earlier releases.
    ----------------------------
    Please see the file ChangeLog.txt.
