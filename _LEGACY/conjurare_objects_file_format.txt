Content that is to be loaded by Conjurare, including 3D models, and 2D
images and movies, is specified in the file `Data/objects.dat`. This
file is a text file, which should be edited using a text editor such as
Wordpad (Windows) or Textedit (Mac).

The file consists of a list of model specifications, each followed by a
blank line. The very first line of the file specifies the number of
model specifications to read from the file.

The format of each individual model specification is as follows:

-   Line 1: the path to model, relative to the "bin" directory. The
    appropriate OpenSceneGraph plugin(s) required to open the file must
    be available to the application. An image or movie file format may
    also be specified, in which case the image or movie file will be
    added into the scene on the x-y plane, with the lower-lefthand
    corner of the image or movie at the origin, and with the movie
    scaled such that the width and/or height of the movie do not exceed
    80.0 units.
-   Line 2: the offset from the center of the marker to the model file's
    origin, in the same units as the camera calibration (usually
    millimeters).
-   Line 3: static orientation of the model, expressed as rotation of a
    specified angle about a specified axis. The first number is a value
    in degrees expressing the angle of rotation. The remaining three
    numbers define the x, y, and z values of a vector defining the axis
    of rotation. So, for example, to rotate a model by 90 degrees on the
    horizontal marker axis (x axis, or the vector {1.0, 0.0, 0.0}), the
    values would be `90.0 1.0 0.0 0.0`.
-   Line 4: the scaling of the model (from its native size) in the x, y,
    and z dimensions.
-   Optional lines (line 5+)

    MARKER n
    :   specifies that this model should be attached to marker 'n'. More
        than one model may be attached to a single marker.

    SCENE n
    :   specifies that this model should be added to the specified
        "scene" (default value of 'n' is 1). When the "active scene" is
        changed (using controls in the application, by default the '\<'
        and '\>' keys on the keyboard) then all models on all markers
        attached to the current scene will be swapped out and replaced
        by the models attached to the new scene.

    CUES_AT time1 [time 2 [... time256]]
    :   specifies times (in decimal seconds) of cue points in the model
        animation. The last cue point defines the end of the animation.
        The token CHAPTERS_AT is an alias for CUES_AT, retained for
        reasons of backwards compatibility.

    LIGHTING n
    :   specifies this model should be lit normally ('n' = 1, default),
        or not lit (model colours will be applied without shading) 'n' =
        0.

    LOOP_MODE n
    :   specifies that any animation loop mode set in the object should
        be overridden. 'n' = 0 is NO_LOOP (i.e. one shot), 'n' = 1 is
        LOOP, 'n' = 2 is SWING (i.e. loop backwards and forwards).

    CAPTION color text
    :   Use 'text' as a caption, displayed when the model is visible on
        screen. 'text' may include spaces. Valid values for 'color'
        include WHITE (the default), BLACK, RED, GREEN, BLUE, CYAN,
        MAGENTA, YELLOW, or an HTML-1.0-style color specification
        consisting of the \# character followed by 3 pairs of
        hexidecimal digits indicating the red, green and blue color
        values (e.g. \#00ff00 for GREEN).

    OVERLAY time1 time2 x y filename
    :   Show image file 'filename' (filename is a relative path from the
        "bin" directory) at position 'x','y' (relative to top-left of
        display) between 'time1' and 'time2' (decimal seconds). If the
        overlay should be showed always, specify 0.0 for both 'time1'
        and 'time2'. Multiple overlays are supported.

-   A blank line

So an example of an entry in the objects.dat file:

`models/animated.osg`\
`0.0 0.0 0.0`\
`90.0 1.0 0.0 0.0`\
`1.0 1.0 1.0`\
`MARKER 1`\
`CUES_AT 0.0 5.0 29.9`

specifies the model "animated.osg" in the folder "models", with offset
of zero, orientation of plus 90 degrees about the x axis, 1.0 scale,
attached to the first marker, and with two cue points at 0.0 and 5.0
seconds into the model's 29.9 second-long animation.
