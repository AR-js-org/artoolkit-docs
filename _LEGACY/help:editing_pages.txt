Easy editing of pages is what wikis are made for. It only takes a few
clicks.

Editing new pages
-----------------

If the page you wish to edit does not exist yet, see [Help:Starting a
new page](/Help:Starting_a_new_page "wikilink")

Editing existing pages
----------------------

-   Click the **edit** [page tab](/Help:Navigation#Page_Tabs "wikilink")
-   Make changes to the text in the edit box. Make sure you write
    clearly and concisely, and make sure your edit does something to
    improve the page. If you're making normal changes to the text like
    fixing spelling mistakes or grammar, inserting new sentences, etc,
    then you don't have to worry too much about formatting. When you do
    need to use some type of formatting, you do it using wiki syntax,
    see [Help:Formatting](/Help:Formatting "wikilink") for some of the
    common types of formatting used.
-   Optionally, enter a short note in the **Summary** box describing
    your changes.
-   Optionally preview your changes with the **Preview** button.
-   Click the **Save page** button.

-   One can rename pages as well See

### Discussion

Every article has its own discussion page where you can ask questions,
make suggestions, or discuss corrections. Click the **discussion** [page
tab](/Help:Navigation#Page_Tabs "wikilink") to reach it. You can sign
your message by writing 4 tildes (\~\~\~\~). The wiki software turns
them into the current time and your username or your current IP address
if you are not logged in.
