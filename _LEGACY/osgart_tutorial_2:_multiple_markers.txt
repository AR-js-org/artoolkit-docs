In this tutorial, we will learn how to add multiple tracked objects to
our scene.

Adding multiple tracked objects is a simply involves creating more
branches in the scene graph, one for each object we want to
independently move.

To avoid confusion, we should point out that we are talking about
tracking multiple discrete markers, rather than an ARToolKit
multi-marker: ARToolKit supports a feature called multi-marker tracking
in which groups of markers are treated as one single marker. This
feature helps alleviate the problem where tracking fails because not all
of a marker is visible. By having lots of markers, the likelihood that
at least one can be seen is high. osgART also supports this feature,
however it is not covered in this tutorial.
