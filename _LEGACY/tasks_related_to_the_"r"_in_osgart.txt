osgART helps place ARToolKit tracking into a higher-level graphics
framework, but careful attention to the real-world part of your AR
application is essential for correct and optimal performance of the
ARToolKit tracking. This includes calibrating the camera (or other video
source) and training the markers. Generally, these tasks are performed
using utilities which come with ARToolKit, or any alternate tracking
library you may be using with osgART.
