What is Conjurare and what can I do with it?
--------------------------------------------

CONJURARE is an application which enables rapid configuration and
presentation of 3D content and 2D content in an augmented reality (AR)
environment. To create the AR environment, Conjurare uses [ARToolKit
Professional](/ARToolKit_Professional "wikilink"), acquiring live video
from a webcam or other camera, and tracking markers in front of the
camera. The markers are squares with black and white borders. The number
and size of the markers, and the picture or barcode on the marker can
all be varied. Conjurare includes the command line tools from ARToolKit
to [create pattern files for new picture-based markers you
create](/Creating_and_training_new_ARToolKit_markers "wikilink"), and to
[calibrate the system to your camera’s lens
parameters](/Calibrating_your_camera "wikilink").

Conjurare uses the [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/)
libraries and plugins to load and render your 3D objects. Thus, any
content that can be viewed in OpenSceneGraph’s osgviewer application
(included with the Conjurare application) can be displayed by Conjurare.
Loadable models include the native .osg and .ive formats (exported from
your modelling program, e.g. 3D Studio Max, or Maya), as well as .3ds,
COLLLADA .dae, Wavefront .obj, and many many more. Conjurare also allows
2D video and static images to be loaded into the AR environment (via the
Apple QuickTime libraries) and be manipulated just like other 3D
content.

Conjurare includes some simple presentation controls, which allow
content to be presented in “scenes”, which can be dynamically swapped in
and out. Animated content (e.g. animations exported from 3D Studio Max
using the osgexp Max plugin) can be paused and restarted, either live or
at preset “cue” points. Finally, Conjurare allows captions and 2D
overlays (including transparent overlays) to be associated with your
content, and shown when your content is in view in the AR environment.

What can’t Conjurare do?
------------------------

-   Conjurare is not a 3D modelling application. It can’t create new 3D
    models or animations. You create 3D (or 2D) content using other
    tools, e.g. 3D Studio Max.
-   Conjurare does not currently support interaction within the AR
    environment. While content can be shown, moved or hidden by moving
    the marker with which the content is associated, the content can’t
    be modified in real-time within Conjurare. For now, interactive AR
    applications should be programmed in C and C++ languages using
    ARToolworks’ [ARToolKit
    Professional](/ARToolKit_Professional "wikilink") and [osgART
    Professional Edition tools](/osgART "wikilink").
-   Conjurare can’t load any content which isn’t loadable by
    OpenSceneGraph or QuickTime. E.g skeletally-animated characters are
    not at present supported in OSG, and therefore not supported in
    Conjurare.
