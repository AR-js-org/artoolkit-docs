About the support library
-------------------------

The ARToolworks support library is a dynamically-updating resource, put
together using the [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) software. This
allows additions and corrections to the documentation to be much more
rapid. It also means that documentation that you have used before may
have moved or changed, but you can view the history of any page to see
an earlier version if you like.

The library is organised into categories, based on product names. The
main category pages are accessible from the [Main
Page](/Main_Page "wikilink"). You can also see an list of all categories
and view each category's index from the
[Special:Categories](/Special:Categories "wikilink") page.

Navigating around the support library
-------------------------------------

At the left of the page is a navigation bar.

Clicking on [Main Page](/Main_Page "wikilink") will always take you back
to the top of the support library.
