Quick start
-----------

Open a command-line window (Terminal on Mac OS X/Linux, cmd.exe on
Windows). Navigate to your ARToolKitNFT/bin directory. The NFT data set
to use must be specified as a command-line argument. As a sample, one
page of the Magicland is provided in ARToolKitNFT/bin/Data/MagicLand3/.
This directory also contains the required feature maps, sets, etc.

Launching simpleNFT
-------------------

We will use the sample “MagicLand” story by Hirokazu Kato to demonstrate
the NFT tracking, via the sample code simpleNFT.

1\. Print out the jpeg file bin/Data/MagicLand3/MagicLand.jpg on a colour
printer.

> The image is 1568 pixels wide and 2164 pixels high, with a resolution
> of 200 dots per inch (dpi). When printed at 1:1 scaling, its printed
> size should be 199.1 mm wide and 274.8 mm tall. This should just fit
> onto a sheet of A4 paper (210 mm x 297 mm) on most printers.\
> \
> If instead you wish to print the image on US Letter paper (8.5 inches
> x 11 inches) the image will need to either be cropped top and bottom,
> or scaled to fit. Cropping will maintain correct distance measurements
> in ARToolKit NFT, at the cost of perhaps losing some of the tracking
> points, whereas scaling will result in measurements returned by
> ARToolKit being scaled by the same amount.

The simpleNFT example expects its configuration file to be specified as
a command-line argument. This means it needs to be either run from a
command or terminal window, or from a shell which can pass command-line
arguments.

2\. On Windows, open a command-shell by typing “cmd” in the “Run” box
found on the Windows start menu. On Mac OS X or Linux, open a Terminal
window.

3\. Change the working directory in your command shell to the
ARToolKitNFT bin directory. On Windows and Mac OS X, you can type “cd”
then leave a space, then drag the bin folder onto the command window;
the full path to the bin folder should be entered automatically.

4\. Type the command to launch simpleNFT, providing the path to the
config file.

> For our example, one sample page of the Magicland story is provided in
> ARToolKitNFT/bin/Data/MagicLand3/. This directory also contains the
> required feature maps, sets, ...\
> \
> To use the sample, type `simpleNFT.exe Data/MagicLand3/config.dat` on
> Windows, or `./simpleNFT Data/MagicLand3/config.dat` on Mac OS X or
> Linux.

5\. Once the application is running, point the camera at the image. Start
by pointing it at the black square labelled “Map” to initialise the
tracking. Once the marker is recognised, yellow squares will be drawn on
top of the page. Then, if pre-trained features on the page are
recognised by the NFT tracker, the yellow squares will turn red.\
\
A green border will also be drawn around the outline of the page.

Changing settings while running simpleNFT
-----------------------------------------

The simpleNFT also allows parameters of the tracking to be changed, and
some debug information to be displayed by pressing keys. The following
keys are active:
