osgART is a library that simplifies the development of augmented reality
or mixed reality applications by combining the ARToolKit’s tracking
capabilities with
[OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg), the
advanced high-level framework for 3D development and processing.

The library offers three main functionalities:

1.  high level integration of video input (video object, shaders)
2.  spatial registration (marker-based, multiple trackers)
3.  photometric registration (e.g. occlusion, shadow).

With osgART, users gain the benefit of all the features of
[OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg):

-   high quality renderer
-   multiple file type loaders
-   community node kits (e.g. osgAL for spatialised audio, etc.)

These features can be used directly in their augmented reality (AR),
mixed reality (MR) or mediated reality applications.

As with the standard ARToolKit, the user can develop and prototype
interactive applications that use tangible interaction, and work in a
variety of coding environments, including the core C++ library, and also
the Python, Lua, and Ruby scripting environments, and others.

osgART Professional Edition
---------------------------

osgART Professional Edition is an advanced version of osgART with
plugins for a variety of different tracking architectures including
ARToolKit Professional and ARToolKit NFT, advanced video input plugins
and support for a much wider variety of video sources, extended examples
including advanced rendering techniques, and much more.

Features:\
\* Transparent integration of video capture through various video
plugins (camera, files, network streaming), video objects (plane, layer,
etc), video shaders (GLSL effects).

-   Spatial Registration: integration of multiple tracker technologies,
    both marker-based or natural feature tracking (ARToolKit, ARToolKit
    Plus, BazAR etc.)
-   Notion of MarkerTransform / LocalMarkerTransform directly in the
    scene graph.
-   Visual Registration: various modes of visualisation are supported,
    ranging from photo-realistic rendering effects such as shadows,
    environment maps and reflections, occlusion, refraction, through to
    non-photo realistic rendering (NPR) effects such as cartoon and
    perceptual simplification renderers.
-   Support for multiple development interfaces beyond C++. It
    integrates with osgIntrospection and provides additional SWIG
    bindings, which support Python, Lua, and Ruby.
-   License compatibility with OSG’s LGPL license terms.
