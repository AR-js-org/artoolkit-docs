Packaging
---------

Packaing refers to the process of taking the built binaries of your
application, finding and collecting any prerequisites for your
application to run, collecting all data files used by your application,
and archiving them together in a format suitable for distribution to end
users.

On some operating systems, it is also advantageous to create an
installer package which the user can run to unpack the archive and set
up your application ready for use on their system.

### Windows

### Mac OS X

#### Building your osgART-based application to run on a machine without OpenSceneGraph installed

If you want to build a drag-installable application (i.e. one that can
be relocated and run from anywhere) you will need to copy the OSG
frameworks and plugins into your application bundle.

To do this, in Xcode select the target for your application. Choose "new
build phase-\>new copy files build phase", and for target choose
"Frameworks". Then, into this build item in the target drag the OSG
frameworks. Similarly, for plugins: choose "new build phase-\>new copy
files build phase", and for target choose "PlugIns". Into this folder,
add the OSG plugins.
