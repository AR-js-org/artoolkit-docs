Where to begin
--------------

The easiest way to set up your own osgART project is to copy the
structure of the osgART simple example, which can be found in the
directory "osgARTTest" inside "src" at the top-level of the osgART
distribution.

You will also need to copy the project settings for your chosen
platform's build system.

Operating system specifics
--------------------------

### Mac OS X

One key addition on Mac OS X is the preprocessor definition used to tell
OpenSceneGraph to use the AGL (Apple Mac OS X OpenGL)-specific
implementation of Producer. This needs to be added to the build settings
of your application. Use the image below as a guide.
