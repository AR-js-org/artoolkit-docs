How do I use it?
----------------

1.  Before the app can be used, you will need a physical print of the
    page images. You can either [download a PDF file of the pages
    here](http://www.artoolworks.com/support/attachments/Codex%20Interactivus-r3-print.pdf)
    and print it from a desktop computer, or use in-app printing options
    screen to print directly from your device. To print from within the
    app, tap the "info" button on the display, then tap the picture of
    the printer. You can print directly to an ["AirPrint"-enabled
    printer](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4356), or use other options
    including emailing the PDF, saving it to iCloud, or printing via
    third-party printing apps, e.g. printing applications from
