Purpose
-------

The checkResolution tool supplied with ARToolKit NFT can help in
determining the required resolution of source image data used in
creating an NFT dataset.

Operational summary
-------------------

1.  Obtain the NFT image to be tracked in printed form.

2.  Print a single standard ARToolKit "Hiro" marker and trim excess
    paper around the outside. The Hiro marker can be printed at any
    size; 40 mm is a good size (approximately 2 inches).

3.  Connect your camera and run from a command prompt.
    -   Windows:
            checkResolution.exe

    -   Mac OS X/Linux:
            ./checkResolution

You will be prompted to enter the size of the Hiro marker. E.g. if
printed at 40 mm size, enter **40**.

1.  The camera is pointed towards the printed image to be tracked, and
    the Hiro marker is positioned so that it is on top of the other
    marker, positioned in the middle of the camera frame. The display
    indicates the tracked marker in green, with a red cross at the
    centre of the marker, and below, the vertical and horizontal
    resolution of the printed image directly under that point.

1.  The camera is moved around (with the Hiro marker moved each time so
    that it remains roughly in the centre of the camera frame) including
    to the maximum and minimum distances the tracked marker is likely to
    be seen from:

has been moved as far away from the tracked image as likely to be
required in normal use - image resolution is around 25

Using the output
----------------

Moving the camera around and observing the DPI values should give you an
idea of the maximum resolution required when producing the digital
version of the printed material to be tracked (although as mentioned
[here](/Training_ARToolKit_NFT_to_a_new_surface#Decide_on_the_image_set_resolutions "wikilink"),
it is not recommended to produce imagery at a higher resolution than the
printed version, which is typically 150dpi). Additionally, the output
helps determine the range of resolutions required when running the
genImageSet tool as the first step in training a new NFT data set.

Solving problems
----------------

-   Be sure to use a camera running at the same frame size as will be
    used in the online tracking process; the DPI values produced depend
    on the camera image size. In spite of megapixel webcams being the
    norm, it is actually better to use a lower resolution camera with a
    higher frame rate; 640x480 is perfectly adequate for most NFT
    tracking situations.
