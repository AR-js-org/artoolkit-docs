ARToolKit for Unity v5.1.3
--------------------------

In this version, a number of the script classes were renamed to improve
clarity in project layout and to avoid naming clashes with other
plugins.

-   ARToolKit -\> ARController
-   Marker -\> ARMarker
-   TrackedCamera -\> ARCamera
-   TransitionalTrackedCamera -\> ARTransitionalCamera

Additionally, the corresponding Unity Editor classes have been renamed,
and some internal classes.

When opening a project created with a previous version of ARToolKit for
Unity, the Unity Editor will be unable to locate the renamed scripts,
and you will have to manually relink the scripts as follows.

1.  On the missing script, click the "Object locator" button,
    highlighted in red in the image below. [<File:ARToolKit> for Unity

2.  From the popup list, select the appropriate replacement, as
    indicated in this example by the highlighted red object.

3.  Repeat for the remaining missing script objects. For missing
    "ARToolKit" scripts, choose "ARController". For missing "Marker"
    scripts, choose "ARMarker". For missing "TrackedCamera" scripts,
    choose "ARCamera".
