FLARToolKit Online Resources
----------------------------

FLARToolKit is an ActionScript port of NyARToolKit, a Java/C\#/Android
port of ARToolKit, the well known AR tracking library developed by Dr.
Hirokazu Kato. ARToolKit is the most popular marker based AR tracking
library and has been ported to many different operating systems and
programming languages. FLARToolKit was mainly developed by Tomohiko
Koyama (aka Saqoosha), and has been used in many high profile web-based
AR applications.

FLARToolKit is provided under a dual license model (GPL and commercial)
and so there is a large community of developers. Many of these
developers have produced online resources to help teach people how to
use FLARToolKit, or examples showing different programming tricks. In
this section we provide links to some of the best online resources.

The main FLARToolKit download page can be found here:
