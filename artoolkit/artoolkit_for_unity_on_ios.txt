Player settings
---------------

-   Resolution and Presentation
    -   Use 32-bit Display Buffer: ticked (yes)
-   Other Settings
    -   Bundle identifier: Set this to the same as the bundle ID of the
        Xcode provisioning profile you intend to use. E.g. if your iOS
        provisioning profile will be "com.mycompany.myapp" then set that
        here.
    -   Target platform: If you are targeting only iOS v4.3 and newer,
        set to "armv7". If you intend to also target iOS v4.0-4.2.x, set
        this to "Universal".
    -   SDK version: iOS latest
    -   Target iOS version
        -   Set to 4.3 or higher if using ARToolKit for Unity v2.0.5 or
            later.
        -   Set to 4.0 or higher if using ARToolKit for Unity v2.0 -
            v2.0.4. You may wish to support only iOS 4.3 and later (and
            thus drop support for the iPhone 3G) or iOS v5.0 and later,
            at your discretion.
    -   Stripping level: it should be safe to strip to at least "Strip
        assemblies" level.
    -   Script call optimization: Fast.

Building the Xcode project exported from Unity

linking is:

-   AVFoundation.framework
-   CoreGraphics.framework
-   CoreMedia.framework
-   CoreVideo.framework
-   OpenGLES.framework
-   QuartzCore.framework
