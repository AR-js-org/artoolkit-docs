ARToolKit is software that lets programmers easily develop Augmented
Reality applications. Augmented Reality (AR) is the embedding of
computer generated content into the natural environment, and has many
potential applications in entertainment, media, advertising, industry,
and academic research.

One of the most difficult parts of developing an augmented reality
application is precisely calculating the user's viewpoint in real time
so that the virtual images are exactly aligned with real world objects.
ARToolKit uses computer vision techniques to calculate the real camera
position and orientation relative to square shapes or flat textured
surfaces, allowing the programmer to overlay virtual objects. The fast,
precise tracking provided by ARToolKit has enabled the rapid development
of thousands of new and interesting AR applications.

The documentation contains a complete description of the ARToolKit
library, how to install it, and how to use its functionality in AR
applications. Several simple sample applications are provided with
ARToolKit to enable the programmer to get started immediately. ARToolKit
includes the tracking libraries and complete source code for these
libraries enabling programming to port the code to a variety of
platforms or customize it for their own applications.

ARToolKit is multi-platform, running on the Windows, Mac OS X, Linux,
iOS and Android operating systems. The functionality of each version of
the toolkit is the same, but the performance may vary depending on the
different hardware configurations. ARToolKit can be easily ported to
other new and experimental platforms.

ARToolKit supports both video and optical see-through augmented reality.
Video see-through AR is where virtual images are overlaid on live video
of the real world. The alternative is optical see-through augmented
reality, where computer graphics are overlaid directly on a view of the
real world. Optical see-through augmented reality typically requires a
see-through head mounted display and has more complicated camera
calibration and registration requirements.

ARToolKit Professional v4.1 Features
------------------------------------

-   Tracking of fiducial markers (black and white marker squares with
    user-definable patterns) in video streams, and compositing of
    computer-generated content to produce video-overlay or see-through
    augmented reality objects.
-   Video stream acquisition from a large variety of cameras and video
    sources, including professional IIDC firewire cameras, consumer
    level USB web cameras, digital video, and a variety of specialist
    video capture sources.
-   Multiple video streams can be captured simultaneously, and
    dynamically switched, or multiplexed for stereo and / or
    multi-user/single-CPU AR applications.
-   Acquisition from pre-recorded and live-streamed remote sources,
    including QuickTime, Video for Windows, RTSP streaming, MPEG4 and
    3GPP streams.
-   Integration with OpenGL for production of AR content and high-speed
    video pass-through, plus rendering of high-level graphical content
    and animations in Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) v2 and
    X3D format.
-   Support for a variety of lens models and optical calibration
    techniques, including ARToolKit v2 lens models and ARToolKit v4
    enhanced lens models. Calibration utilities allow users to
    accurately and automatically calculate lens characteristics of the
    cameras in use.
-   Modern object-oriented API design allows multiple tracker instances,
    supporting applications with multiple users and stereo AR.
-   Advanced 2D-barcode support for high-speed tracking in applications
    with a large number of markers and / or reduced requirement for
    human-readable markers.
-   Multi-platform support, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS and
    Android, in 32- and 64-bit variants.
-   High-speed, low CPU-usage tracking scales well across different CPU
    speeds and capabilities.
-   Line-of-sight inference from head-mounted cameras.
