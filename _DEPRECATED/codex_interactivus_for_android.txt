Requirements
------------

    be used to download camera calibration data for your device.

How do I use it?
----------------

1.  Before the app can be used, you will need a physical print of the
    page images. You can either [download a PDF file of the pages
    here](http://www.artoolworks.com/support/attachments/Codex%20Interactivus-r3-print.pdf)
    and print it from a desktop computer, or use Google Cloud Print to
    print directly from your device. To use Google Cloud Print, use the
    menu bar button or press the menu button (on devices with a hardware
    menu button) and choose the "Print" option, and follow the prompts.
2.  Once the page images are printed, point the camera at the pages.
3.  To change the camera or camera resolution used, you can use the
    Settings menu. If you have a faster device, you might wish to use a
    higher-resolution camera setting.
